Hi, I'm Mattia!ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Harvard Medical School in Biomarkers of Chronic and Complex Diseases with with a focus on applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) to biomedical data. 
- My work primarily involves the analysis of various data types, including neuroimaging modalities such as PET, MRI (T1-weighted, T2 FLAIR, DTI, and fMRI), CT, along with Magnetoencephalography/ Electroencephalography data (M/EEG), and genetic data, with a particular emphasis on developing Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for predictive modeling. 
- Extensive expertise in applying advanced statistical modeling, signal processing, feature engineering, and multimodal data fusion techniques to extract meaningful patterns from complex datasets.
- Several projects have involved the processing and analysis of diverse data sources, including imaging, genetic, M/EEG, and electronic health records (EHR) data, which I have utilized across multiple research projects for large-scale, multimodal analysis.
