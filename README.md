Hi, I'm Mattia!ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Research Fellow at Harvard Medical School in Biomarkers of Chronic and Complex Diseases with with a focus on applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) to biomedical data. 
- My work primarily involves neuroimaging modalities such as PET, MRI (including T1-weighted, T2 FLAIR, DTI, and fMRI), and CT, with a particular emphasis on developing Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for predictive modeling. 
- Several projects involved the processing and analysis of diverse data types, including imaging, genetic, M/EEG, and electronic health records data, which I have utilized across multiple research projects for big data analysis.
- Extensive expertise in the implementation and interpretation of statistical models, as well as ML and DL algorithms.
- Passionate about expanding my expertise in state-of-the-art Deep Learning techniques
